<h2>Embedded challenge - Archive verification with using id DMA controller and MD5 encryption algori thm</h2>
<br/>

The purpose of this application is with using of the LPC1769 microcontroller and MD5 encryption algorithm
to verify archive stored on the flash memory. The archive contains header, chunks and ending. The header is
composed from three fields. The first field is preambule, second is number of chunks and size of each chunk.
